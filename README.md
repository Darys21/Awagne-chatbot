## Welcome to the Poe API tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a bot using the Poe API.

### Step 1: Install the Poe API client

The first step is to install the Poe API client. You can do this by running the following command:

```
pip install poe-api-client
```

### Step 2: Create a new bot

Once you have installed the Poe API client, you can create a new bot by running the following command:

```
poe create-bot
```

This will create a new bot in your Poe account. You will be given a unique bot ID and a secret key.

### Step 3: Write your bot code

Now that you have created a new bot, you need to write your bot code. You can do this by creating a new file called `main.py`.

In this file, you will need to import the Poe API client and create a new instance of the `Bot` class.

You can then use the `Bot` class to send and receive messages from your users.

For example, the following code will send a message to your user:

```
bot.send_message("Hello, world!")
```

### Step 4: Deploy your bot

Once you have written your bot code, you need to deploy it to a server. You can do this by using a service like Heroku or AWS.

Once your bot is deployed, you can start receiving messages from your users.

### Step 5: Test your bot

Once your bot is deployed, you can test it by sending it a message from your own account.

You can use the `poe send-message` command to send a message to your bot.

For example, the following command will send the message "Hello, bot!" to your bot:

```
poe send-message <your-bot-id> "Hello, bot!"
```

### Step 6: Share your bot

Once you are happy with your bot, you can share it with your friends and family. You can do this by sending them the link to your bot's website.

You can also share your bot on social media.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have now created a bot using the Poe API.
